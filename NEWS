gf2x-1.2:
    - changed the type representing the polynomial sizes from "unsigned int"
      to "unsigned long". On a 64-bit machine, the maximal degree was
      2^38-1, now it is 2^70-1.

gf2x-1.1: (bugfix release)
    - We're considering using this file for the first time.
    - Redone tuning.
    - Fixed a couple of build failures, and autoconf warnings.
    - Added a faster mul4
    - Added some support for cross compilation (might also have been
      broken in the meantime, we don't have regression testing for this).
    
    The interface is unchanged, so the shared library version has not
    changed and still is 1.0.0
